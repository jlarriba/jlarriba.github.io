				<p>So, a new blog has born on the 21st century internet. No blogging platform, no Medium, no content aggregation, no social media. Just a good old fashioned web page where a guy rambles against things or supports other things. We&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s that me that is going to be the star of the thing? Software engineer, systems administrator, mix of both, father, lover. You can find all the <em>interesting</em> crap in my Linkedin profile, here is irrelevant. I am old enough to remember the old internet, before the <em>companies</em> and the <em>market</em> were interested in this no-man-land.</p>
<p>I used to write a blog, many years ago. Back then, blogs were just diaries people used to pour over the internet without worrying about <em>marketing</em>, <em>monetization</em> or even worse <em>followers</em> were a thing. When all that thing appeared, I moved myself away.</p>
<p>No Facebook, no Google+, a couple of Medium posts, a Twitter account that has not published anything for months. No Yotube collection or Instagram account. Not a fan of social media networks, uh? The best chance to get in touch is Github. I have some published projects there and hopefully more to come, trying to give back to the community a tiny piece of what</p>
<p>Anyway, I just wanted a little space on this (previously) decentralized network to talk a little about everything. Do not expect to much coherence, as people change when they learn: it was called growing. Expect a lot of topics on my favourite subject: &ldquo;ramblings of an old man&rdquo;.</p>
<p>See you in space, space cowboy!</p>
