				<p>Today is going to be a funny story.</p>
<p>David Heinemeier Hansson is the CTO of a small company called Basecamp and a very public figure in the field of software because it is the creator of Ruby on Rails.</p>
<p>Currently, he is in the middle of a huge launch of their new product: HEY.com, an email service (innovative, uh?). This email service comes packed with innovative features, the most important one is that it does not support any know email protocol. Not SMTP, not IMAP, not nothing. To be able to access your email you can do it through the webapp or via a series of propietary clients created for each platform.</p>
<p>Windows, Linux and MacOS are supported via electron, while, apparently, iOS and Android have native applications also generated from the same HTML as everything else. Nothing strange here, this is a very common pattern of developing multiplatform software nowadays. They claim that they do not spy on you and, as such, the charge an annual subscription in order to use the service. Good.</p>
<p>David describes himself as an Apple EVANGELIST (his caps not mine) for more than 20 years:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">AND I AM PARTLY ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE! I&#39;m desperately searching for a way to reconcile my lived experience of the company (be it Apple Card/keyboards/this) with the mental image I WANT TO HAVE. I&#39;ve been an Apple users for 20+ years. Hell, EVANGELIST for 20+ years. Stings triple.</p>&mdash; DHH (@dhh) <a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1273060785728573442?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 17, 2020</a></blockquote>

<p>However, Apple takes 30% of every in-app purchase that is done using their app store apps. As we all know by know, you cannot install anything in an iPhone/iPad that does not come from Apple&rsquo;s store. How Apple managed to get thousands or even hundreds of thousands of computer savvy people that this is a good model still escapes to me.</p>
<p>So, our friend DHH (the postmodern) decided that he did not want to pay Apple&rsquo;s (the capitalist), and he hid a link on the app that redirect to his own payment platform outside of Apple&rsquo;s, apparently using all the experience he and his team already have with Apple Store&rsquo;s tricks. For the first version of the app, the link was sufficiently well hidden that Apple reviewers didn&rsquo;t notice, and approved the app.</p>
<p>However, they needed to submit an update to the app to solve a bug, and while inspecting that version, the reviewer actually found the hidden link and did not let the app go through. As DHH complained, they found what he was trying to do, and they said that he goes under Apple&rsquo;s terms (use Apple&rsquo;s payment platform and pay 30%) or go out of the store. This is a perfectly fine behaviour of a trillion dollar company under the late capitalism that plagues the US, but our postmodern friend is raging against it, calling Apple a &ldquo;mafia&rdquo; and the 30% cut &ldquo;pay for protection&rdquo;, deeming that it &ldquo;destroys small businesses&rdquo; and &ldquo;is trying to crush direct competition&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Was not Apple doing that during the 20 years of evangelization? Was not before &ldquo;playing with the rules of market&rdquo;, when they were crushing other competitors?</p>
<p>Well, as they said more than 20 years ago The Simpsons, when Bill Gates appeared to &ldquo;buy&rdquo; Homer&rsquo;s internet company:</p>

<p>The postmodern discovery of late capitalism and its rules and the anger and frustration can be enojoyed on DHH&rsquo;s Twitter thread:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Wow. I&#39;m literally stunned. Apple just doubled down on their rejection of HEY&#39;s ability to provide bug fixes and new features, unless we submit to their outrageous demand of 15-30% of our revenue. Even worse: We&#39;re told that unless we comply, they&#39;ll REMOVE THE APP.</p>&mdash; DHH (@dhh) <a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1272968382329942017?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 16, 2020</a></blockquote>

<p>Take care when you decide to evangelize, a trillion dollar company does not care about you.</p>
