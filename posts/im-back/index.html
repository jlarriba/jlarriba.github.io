				<p>In the beginning of time, this blog was hosted by myself in the rack servers I host in my garage. However, those rack servers, even if they make a nice homelab, are way too old (they were way too cheap) and are way too powerful to be powered one just to host my tiny blog.</p>
<p>So I powered them down and moved the site to a Raspberry Pi 4 stored in a drawer. That worked pretty well, until I found that my ISP has the funny habit to reboot my router to force it to get a new IP each month. They never tell me that in advance, so for some days the blog is again down until I figure out that the IP changed.</p>
<p>The solution might be to change ISP, but mine is really cheap and everything else works too well to pay the overprice for an ISP that will not change my IP every month. So, at this moment, I have decided to host the blog on github pages, under a new address <a href="https://blog.jlarriba.es">https://blog.jlarriba.es</a>.</p>
<p>This will improve the uptime by a lot, even if it is using free cloud capabilities I am not very fond of. But whatever, for the moment, it will work.</p>
